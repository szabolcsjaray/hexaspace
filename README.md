# hexaspace

Hexaspace started from a Trionimo game, that is a set of regular triangle tiles, can be played similar to domino.
Based on that I tried to implement a labyrinth on triangular covering of the plane. 

While implementing it, I used different colors for wall growing directions. 
That produced nice drawings, so I shifted to drawing direction.
I also added the controls for the drawing parameters, and the possibility for saving the generated pictures.

The project is HTML5 and Javascript based.
